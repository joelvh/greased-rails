# Create a file like this in your application if you want to use the default 
# greased_settings.yml template in your application and only specify a couple changes 
# without creating a whole new greased_settings.yml file.
#
# The settings in this file will be applied after the greased_settings.yml file 
# is applied to the application environment.
# 
# *** NOTE ***
# 
# For the "defaults" section to have any effect, you have to specify the environment 
# that should inherit from the defaults when loading these settings. Otherwise 
# the settings will be ignored rather than be applied to all environments.
